# DevConnector 2.0

> Social network for developers

This is a MERN stack application from the "MERN Stack Front To Back" course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/mern-stack-front-to-back/?couponCode=TRAVERSYMEDIA). It is a small social network app that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.

# Updates since course published

Such is the nature of software, things change frequently and packages are continuously evolving.
Hopefully the below will help you adjust your course code to manage the most notable changes.

## Changes to GitHub API authentication

Since the course was published, GitHub has [depreciated authentication via URL query parameters](https://developer.github.com/changes/2019-11-05-deprecated-passwords-and-authorizations-api/#authenticating-using-query-parameters)
You can get an access token by following [these instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line)
For this app we don't need to add any permissions so don't select any in the _scopes_.
**DO NOT SHARE ANY TOKENS THAT HAVE PERMISSIONS**
This would leave your account or repositories vulnerable, depending on permissions set.

It would also be worth adding your `default.json` config file to `.gitignore`
If git has been previously tracking your `default.json` file then...

```bash
git rm --cached config/default.json
```

Then add your token to the config file and confirm that the file is untracked with `git status` before pushing to GitHub.
GitHub does have your back here though. If you accidentally push code to a repository that contains a valid access token, GitHub will revoke that token. Thanks GitHub üôè

You'll also need to change the options object in `routes/api/profile.js` where we make the request to the GitHub API to...

```js
const options = {
  uri: encodeURI(
    `https://api.github.com/users/${req.params.username}/repos?per_page=5&sort=created:asc`
  ),
  method: 'GET',
  headers: {
    'user-agent': 'node.js',
    Authorization: `token ${config.get('githubToken')}`
  }
};
```

### npm package request depreciated

As of 11th February202 [request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/request) has been depreciated and is no longer maintained.
We already use [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) in the client so we can easily change the above fetching of a users GitHub repositories to use axios.

Install axios in the root of the project

```bash
npm i axios
```

We can then remove the client installation of axios.

```bash
cd client
npm uninstall axios
```

Client use of the axios module will be resolved in the root, so we can still use it in client.

Change the above GitHub API request to..

```js
const uri = encodeURI(
  `https://api.github.com/users/${req.params.username}/repos?per_page=5&sort=created:asc`
);
const headers = {
  'user-agent': 'node.js',
  Authorization: `token ${config.get('githubToken')}`
};

const gitHubResponse = await axios.get(uri, { headers });
```

You can see the full change in [routes/api/profile.js](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector_2.0/blob/4be414c6a54994c18397dba9c927ad67b878508b/routes/api/profile.js#L324)

## uuid no longer has a default export

The npm package [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) no longer has a default export, so in our [client/src/actions/alert.js](https://github.com/bradtraversy/devconnector_2.0/blob/master/client/src/actions/alert.js) we need to change the import and use of this package.

change

```js
import uuid from 'uuid';
```

to

```js
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';
```

And where we use it from

```js
const id = uuid();
```

to

```js
const id = uuidv4();
```

# Quick Start

### Add a default.json file in config folder with the following

```
{
  "mongoURI": "<your_mongoDB_Atlas_uri_with_credentials>",
  "jwtSecret": "secret",
  "githubToken": "<yoursecrectaccesstoken>"
}
```

### Install server dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Install client dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Run both Express & React from root

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

```bash
cd client
npm run build
```

### Test production before deploy

```bash
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```
